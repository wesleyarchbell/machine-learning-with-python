# Simple Linear Regression

## Overview
This example demonstrates Simple Linear Regression with a single feature (X) predicting a target variable (y). It's an excellent introduction to regression analysis and machine learning concepts.

## Use Case
The model demonstrates a simple linear relationship where:
- y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
- β₀ is the y-intercept
- β₁ is the slope
- ε is the error term

## Why Linear Regression?
Simple Linear Regression is appropriate here because:
1. There's a clear linear relationship between variables
2. We're working with a single predictor variable
3. It provides easily interpretable results
4. It's computationally efficient

## Results
The notebook shows:
- Clear linear relationship between variables
- Separate training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
- Visual representation of the regression line
- Actual vs. predicted value comparisons
